# BasCoR
Designed to build a Python-based library of computational intelligence made of genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization ,for finding optimal solutions to problem functions ,In the later stage, other algorithms such as fuzzy logic, ant algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm will be addedThere are still some inadequacies here. Please give me more advice
